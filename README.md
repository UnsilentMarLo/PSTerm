# PSTerm
 A powerful native PowerShell Serial/SSH Terminal.

 The PS Script can be run in any modern Powershell and can be compiled into a more portable exe.

 This uses ps2exe and PoshSSH.

 If you require signed scripts use the cert scripts to get a certificate.

 the Scripts in the /src folder are just copies of the ones in the main directory.
